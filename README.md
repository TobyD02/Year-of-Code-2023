# What is Year of Code?

Starting this year (2023) I decided I want to start an annual challenge of taking on 12 new programming challenges, one each month. As this is the first year I am doing it, and it is already January 23rd and also because I have my dissertation to do this year, I imagine this first year will not be overly complex projects. Maybe my dissertation will become one of the projects who knows.

I also might do a summary website as my final project each year.
